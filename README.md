## Bubbler - Raspberry Pi Passive-Infrared-Sensor-driven sound player

To play sounds through the headphone jack (rather than via HDMI):
'''
sudo amixer cset numid=3 1
'''
(1 selects headphone socket.)

See http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/parent-detector/worksheet for a similar use of PIR sensors.
